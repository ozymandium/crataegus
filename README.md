## To Do
- Basic password auth for different users
- get rid of unwrap / graceful error handling
- figure out sqlite backup
    - rusqlite has backup integration as a feature
    - how to integrate into restic?
- figure out if there's a more built-in way to parse the body, possibly using axum_serde crate and/or having the data as url parameters
- status code returns in the server
